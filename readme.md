# Chunk and Label

This is a set of files which assist the splitting and categorizing of audio files.

To run the splitting program, run split_app.py, which will prompt you to choose a file to split and will label its VAD percentage.

To run the categorization prototype, run categorize_app.py. This does not currently have any effect other than the GUI.
